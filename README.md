## Tech Stack

- **Django**  Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework,
 which follows the model-view-template architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software
 Foundation, an independent organization established as a 501 non-profit. 
Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. [Django Project](https://www.djangoproject.com/) <br>
It is used in this project, to handle all routes, rendering pages, managing databases, 
user authentication and almost all the stuff of which the application is capable of.
- **SQLite** SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. In contrast to many other database management systems, 
SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program<br>
It comes with Django with itself, no setup required, hence easy to use, but is not recommended for large scale
production application.
- **Bootstrap** Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end Web framework. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other
 interface components as well as optional JavaScript extensions. [Get Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) <br>
Used for stylising frontend.
